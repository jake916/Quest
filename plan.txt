Here is the comprehensive plan for addressing the login bug:

### Plan:
1. **Backend/Routes/auth.js**:
   - Ensure that the login route correctly returns an error message when a user attempts to log in with an email that does not exist in the database. This is already implemented, but we will verify that it is functioning as expected.

2. **src/api/auth.js**:
   - Modify the `loginUser` function to throw an error if the response indicates that the user was not found. This will prevent the function from returning a token when the login fails.

3. **src/pages/login.jsx**:
   - Update the `handleLogin` function to ensure that it does not proceed to the dashboard if the login fails due to a non-existent user. Instead, it should display the appropriate error message.

### Follow-up Steps:
- Test the login functionality to ensure that the changes work as expected.
- Verify that the user receives the correct error message when attempting to log in with a non-existent account.
